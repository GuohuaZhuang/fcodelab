A B+ tree is an n-ary tree with a variable but often large number of children per node. A B+ tree consists of a root, internal nodes and leaves. The root may be either a leaf or a node with two or more children. [comes from wikipedia]
B+ tree is similar to B tree, with a few slight differences:
	1. All data is stored at the leaf nodes (leaf pages); all other nodes (index pages) only store keys.
	2. Leaf pages are linked to each other.
	3. Keys may be duplicated; every key to the right of a particular key is >= to that key.

B+ tree operatoration procedure.

B+ tree Insertion
	1. Insert at bottom level.
	2. If leaf page overflows, split page and copy middle element to next index page.
	3. If index page overflows, split page and move middle element to next index page.

B+ tree Deletion
	1. Delete key and data from leaf page.
	2. If leaf page underflows, merge with sibling and delete key in between them.
	3. If index page underflows, merge with sibling and move down key in between them.
