B-trees are balance search trees designed to work well on disks or other direct-access secondary storage advices. B-trees are similar to red-black trees, but they are better at minimizing disk I/O operations. Many database systems use B-trees, or variants of B-Trees, to store information.
B-Trees differ from red-black trees in that B-Tree nodes may have many chlidren, from a few to thousands. That is, the "branching factor" of a B-tree can be quite large, although it useually depends on characteristics of the disk unit used. B-trees differ from red-black trees in that B-tree nodes may have many children, from a few to thousands. That is, the "branching factor" of a B-tree can be quite large, although it useually depends on characteristics of the disk unit used. B-trees exact height of a B-tree can be considerably less than that of a red-black tree, however, because its branching factor.
